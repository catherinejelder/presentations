A collection of short personal presentations from my time at the Recurse Center.

To take a look, first install [Cleaver](https://github.com/jdan/cleaver):

```sh
npm install -g cleaver
# To update: npm upgrade -g cleaver
```

Generate the html presentation:

```bash
cleaver path/to/something.md
```

View the presentation:

```bash
open path/to/basic.html
```
